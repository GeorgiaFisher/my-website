    Recently I have been looking into work by Bridget Riley which presented itself with the opportunity to visit her Retrospective exhibition at the Hayward Gallery in London. Rileyâ€™s art not only interacts with the viewer, but allows them to interact back, not only through headache inducing patterns and colours, but with the overall scale and amounts of work presented.

     Bridget Riley presents her paintings across the Hayward Gallery with force and agression. By the time one has viewed a handfull of works, one begings to question what they're looking at.
