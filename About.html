        Georgia Fisher is a mixed media artist currently exploring language and linguistic devices through her installations. Coding and technology make an appearance through re allocating symbols and shapes to the English alphabet and contrasting man-made details with those made by the machine and technology.

        Working in photography, painting, sculpture, video and drawing Georgia Fisher contrasts natural elements of everyday life with progressions of technology in different levels within all her projects.
